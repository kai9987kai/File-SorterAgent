### Updated Description and Instructions for the **File-SorterAgent**

The **File-SorterAgent** is an advanced reinforcement learning-based system designed to automatically organize files in a directory. It uses a neural network to decide which folder a file should be moved to (e.g., `documents`, `images`, `music`) based on its type, content, and metadata. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct moves and penalties for mistakes. Over time, it improves its accuracy by training on past experiences, making it an efficient and adaptive solution for file organization.

### Key Features:
1. **File Type Detection**: Automatically detects file types using extensions (e.g., `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.mp3`).
2. **Content Analysis**: Reads text files (`.txt`, `.docx`) to extract keywords for better categorization.
3. **Dynamic Folder Creation**: Creates folders like `work` or `personal` based on file content or metadata.
4. **Asynchronous Operations**: Moves files asynchronously for improved performance.
5. **Enhanced State Representation**: Uses file size, creation date, and content keywords to make better decisions.
6. **User Feedback**: Allows users to provide feedback to improve the agent's learning (future implementation).

### Instructions for Using the File-SorterAgent

Follow these steps to use the **File-SorterAgent** to automatically organize files in a directory:

---

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `argparse`, `shutil`, `python-docx`.

---

### 2. **Install Required Libraries**
Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow python-docx
```

---

### 3. **Download the Script**
- Save the script provided earlier as `file_sorter_agent.py` on your computer.

---

### 4. **Run the Script**
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python file_sorter_agent.py --directory /path/to/your/directory
```

- Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the path to the directory you want to organize.
- If you don't specify a directory, the script will use the current directory (`.`).

---

### 5. **How It Works**
- The agent scans the directory for files.
- It reads text files (`.txt`, `.docx`) to extract keywords for better categorization.
- It moves files into folders based on their types and content (e.g., `.pdf` files to `documents`, `.jpg` files to `images`).
- It creates dynamic folders (e.g., `work`, `personal`) based on file content or metadata.
- It logs every file move and folder creation in the terminal.
- The agent learns from its actions and improves over time.

---

### 6. **Example**
To organize files in the `Downloads` folder, run:

```bash
python file_sorter_agent.py --directory ~/Downloads
```

---

### 7. **Stopping the Script**
- The script will stop automatically after organizing all files.
- To stop it manually, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

---

### 8. **Troubleshooting**
- **Error: No such file or directory**: Ensure the directory path is correct and accessible.
- **Error: TensorFlow not found**: Make sure TensorFlow is installed correctly (`pip install tensorflow`).
- **Error: python-docx not found**: Install the `python-docx` library (`pip install python-docx`).

---

### 9. **Customization**
- Modify the `file_types` dictionary in the script to add or change file categories.
- Adjust the `dynamic_folders` dictionary to customize folder naming based on content.
- Tune the reward values in the `settings` dictionary to fine-tune the agent's learning.

---

### 10. **Future Improvements**
- **User Feedback**: Allow users to provide feedback on the agent's actions to improve learning.
- **Advanced Metadata**: Use additional metadata (e.g., tags, author) for better categorization.
- **Cloud Integration**: Integrate with cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox) for remote file organization.

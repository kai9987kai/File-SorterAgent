# File-SorterAgent

The File Organizer Agent is a reinforcement learning-based system designed to automatically organize files in a directory. It uses a neural network to decide which folder a file should be moved to (e.g., documents, images, music) based on its type. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct moves and penalties for mistakes. Over time, it improves its accuracy by training on past experiences, making it an efficient and adaptive solution for file organization.
